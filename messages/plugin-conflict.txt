ESLint found that the plugin "<%- pluginName %>" was conflicted.

The following config files loaded different versions of the plugin:

1. <%- plugin1.importerPath %>
2. <%- plugin2.importerPath %>

ESLint cannot load multiple versions of the same plugin at the same time.
Please resolve that conflict.

If you still have problems, please stop by https://gitter.im/eslint/eslint to chat with the team.
