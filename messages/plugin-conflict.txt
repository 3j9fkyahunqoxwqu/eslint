ESLint found that the plugin "<%- pluginName %>" was conflicted.

The following config files loaded the different versions of the plugin:

1. <%- importerPath1 %>
2. <%- importerPath2 %>

ESLint cannot load the multiple versions of a plugin at the same time.
Please resolve that conflict.

If you still have problems, please stop by https://gitter.im/eslint/eslint to chat with the team.
